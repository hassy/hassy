### Hi, I'm Hassy.

I started working on [artilleryio/artillery](https://github.com/artilleryio/artillery) back in 2015, and then started a company around it in 2021. Our mission is to help improve performance & reliability of the world's software.

You can read more about what we're doing in my blog post on [the future of tooling for SRE & production engineering](https://www.blitz.st/posts/next-stage-of-sre-tooling).

📚 My professional interests include sustainable open source, cloud infrastructure and automation, SRE, software performance, and SaaS.

🏞️ In my spare time I like to be outside - hiking, surfing, swimming, or [carving](https://carverskateboards.com/). But with a toddler and a new baby at home there's not much spare time these days. :)

🌳 If my open source work has saved you some time or made your job easier, consider [planting a tree](https://ecologi.com/artilleryio) to say thanks and for good karma.
