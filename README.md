### Hi, I'm Hassy.

🛠️ I am the lead developer of [Artillery](https://artillery.io). Artillery's mission is to help dev teams run fast and reliable systems. Happy users and silent PagerDuty alarms, what could be better?! **We're hiring!** Work remotely, on an open-source product used and loved by developers worldwide. Drop me a line if you want to know more via [h@artillery.io](mailto:h@artillery.io).

📚 My professional interests include sustainable open source, cloud infrastructure and automation, SRE, software performance, and SaaS.

🌳 In my spare time I like to be outside - hiking, surfing, swimming, or [carving](https://carverskateboards.com/).
