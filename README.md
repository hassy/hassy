### Hi, I'm Hassy.

🛠️ I am the lead developer of [Artillery](https://artillery.io). Artillery's mission is to help dev teams run fast and reliable systems. Happy users and silent PagerDuty alarms, what could be better?!

👩‍💻 **Join us!** Work remotely, work on open source, build products used & loved by developers worldwide. We're only getting started! Drop me a line if you want to know more via [h@artillery.io](mailto:h@artillery.io).

📚 My professional interests include sustainable open source, cloud infrastructure and automation, SRE, software performance, and SaaS.

🏞️ In my spare time I like to be outside - hiking, surfing, swimming, or [carving](https://carverskateboards.com/).

🌳 If my open source work has saved you some time or made your job easier, consider [planting a tree](https://ecologi.com/artilleryio) to say thanks and for good karma.
